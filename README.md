# MCU Manager (Web Bluetooth)

For library is forked from boogie's webapp: https://github.com/boogie/mcumgr-web

This library provides access to MCU Manager that can manage remote devices running the Mynewt OS or Zephyr RTOS. It uses a connection profile to establish a connection with a device and sends command requests to the device.

The main focus is implementing firmware updates via Web Bluetooth, however other commands might be supported as well.

The Web Bluetooth API provides the ability to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals. Youâ€™ll find Web Bluetooth:

- on the desktop (or laptop) in Chrome, Edge and Opera browsers (make sure you have the latest)
- on Android phones in Chrome (perhaps in Edge or Opera?)
- on iOS or iPadOS there is [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055) that seems to be working.

Safari, Chrome, Edge and Opera on iOS are using the Safari WebKit engine which not yet supports Web Bluetooth. Mobile and desktop Firefox is not implemented it yet, too.

You can try MCU Manager by visiting https://boogie.github.io/mcumgr-web/ with a supported browser. For security reasons, Web Bluetooth is only working on https addresses or localhost.
